## About Me

I’m passionate about building modern, responsive web experiences and improving my skills every day.  

Currently, I’m doing a **12-month full-time Fullstack Bootcamp**, focusing on creating real projects and learning best practices along the way.  

I enjoy turning ideas into real projects and exploring different ways to solve problems.  

This GitHub profile is where I share my progress on my learning journey, so feel free to follow along and stay updated as I grow and build new things.
